#Tokenization

In this I m diving a sentence into tokens including special characters as well. After diving into tokens I m assigning each work a random number depending on the length of the number and if it is a special charachter it will be assigned any random 2 digit number.

So, first we calling tokenization(token) function where we first divide sentence into tokens after that we call randomNumberWithLength(len) function where we give random numbers based on the length of the word.
